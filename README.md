# Project ideas for aspiring developers

This repository hosts a heap of ideas and links to resources for aspiring developers to go through. Most people learn from either doing something themselves or by watching others, thats why building a personal project that you have an interest in is a great way to learn. By learning to build the project you will pick up new skills along the way.

## Hints and tips

- Think about the user experience of the project and who it is aimed at.
- Consider adding logging to your project to help with debugging.
- Manage your own environment by using tools such as **virtualenv**, **Docker**, **VM's**.
- Save yourself the headache of losing work by version controlling your code with **git**.
- Make it easy for your future self and others by documenting your code and projects detailing how to run it, the features it does/doesn't have and areas for improvement.
- If you have peers/friends that are also developers then ask them to do a code review.
- Follow a style guide such as [google's style guide for Python](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and use tools that help you enforce it such as [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for Python and a good IDE such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Get into the habit of building testable code and make unit tests as part of your project.
- Share your projects on GitHub! This will help you with future job opportunities and acts as free storage.
